# ft_printf

ft_printf is a 42 project where we need to recreate form scrap the function printf from C without libraries
and at least the flags `sSpdDioOuUxXcC` `#0-+ ` `hhllhljz` precision and file length.

I added the flags `bBmn`, for binary, written length and errors, as well as `%{color}` flags.

To launch the project, just `make all` and run your tests.
